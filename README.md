pyFilehash
==========

This Python script measures hash performance, and attempts to answer this question:     "Given a hash function and a block size for reading, which is the fastest hash function and block size?"  There's no warm up, there's no cache/memory/whatever filling. It's just a simple way to explore performance for commonly used functions with the timeit library.
